# Data Upload Instructions

## Prepare Dataset
At this point, you have a spreadsheet with drain data.  Use the check sheet below to get yourself organized.

### Dataset - Check Sheet

|    | Checks | Detail |
| :- | :- | :- |
| * | Data Format | Loads spreadsheets (Excel, CSV) |
| * | Data Format | Convert Mac Numbers spreadsheets to a CSV-File before loading  |
| * | File Name | e.g., **catch basins 2018.08.csv** or **gr catch basins 2018.08.29.csv** |
| * | Columns | SUBTYPE, DRAIN_JURISDICTION, DRAIN_OWNER, Soure_ID, LOCAL_ID, FACILITYID, Subwatershed, POINT_X, POINT_Y  |
| * |  | Try to keep column names constant. Don't change them from upload to upload ... bad, bad, very bad |
| * | Store | Put **XLS-File** or **CSV-File** somewhere easy to find on your computer. |


## Upload Dataset
Raw data needs to be uploaded to GitHub. Use the check sheet below to get yourself organized.
Warning: Read all the instructions before you attempt an upload.

### GitHub - Check Sheet
 Finding links and buttons in GitHub can be challenging.  You need to do a little reconnaissance before you upload your XLS-file or CSV-File.

|    | GitHub Checks |
| :- | :- |
| * |  **Confirm** you are in the **data.world/raw-data/adopt-a-drain** GitHub folder   |
| * |  **Find** the "**upload files**" button  |
| * |  **Find** the your **XLS-File** or **CSV-File** file in that easy to find folder on your computer  |

### Upload Dataset
Read all before you start pressing buttons

| Step |  Task |
| :- | :- |
| 1. | **Press** the "**upload files**" button |
|   | * Opens upload page |
|   | * Follow instructions on the upload page |
| 2. | **Commit Section** |
|   | **Select** the "**Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**" radio button |
|   | * Safe to ignore "file via update" |
|   | * Safe to ignore "add an optional extended description"   |
|   | * Accept the default pull request name (aka branch name)
| 3. | **Press** on the "**Propose Changes**" button |
|   | * Opens "pull request" page |
| 4. | [Notify Developer](#notify-developer)|

<a id="notify-developer"></a>
## Notify Developer (aka Pull Request)
Notification occurs during what GitHub calls a **pull request.**  Is what it is.  

### Notification - Check Sheet

|    | Notification Checks |
| :- | :- |
| * | You should be on the **Open a pull request** page after uploading **XLS-File** or **CSV-File.**  |
| * |  **Find** the "**Assignees**" link  |
| * |  **Find** the "**Create pull request**" button |

### Notification Steps
Read all before you start pressing buttons

| Step |  Task |
| :- | :- |
| 1. | **Click** on the "**Assignees**" link |
|   | **Select** a **Developer** (e.g., James Wilfong) |
| 2. | Ignore "Add files via upload" |
|   | Ignore "Leave a comment" |
| 3. | **Press** the "**Create pull request**" button |

### That completes the Raw Data Upload process.
