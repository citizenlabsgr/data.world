### Dataset - Check Sheet

|    | Checks | Detail |
| :- | :- | :- |
| * | Data Format | Convert spreadsheet (Excel, Numbers, ...) to a CSV-File (if needed)  |

| * | Columns | SUBTYPE, DRAIN_JURISDICTION, DRAIN_OWNER, Soure_ID, LOCAL_ID, FACILITYID, Subwatershed, POINT_X, POINT_Y  |
| * |  | Try to keep column names constant. Don't change them from upload to upload ... bad, bad, very bad |
| * | Store | Put **CSV-File** somewhere easy to find on your computer. |


## Upload Dataset
Raw data needs to be uploaded to GitHub. Use the check sheet below to get yourself organized.
Warning: Read all the instructions before you attempt an upload.

### GitHub - Check Sheet
 Finding links and buttons in GitHub can be challenging.  You need to do a litte reconnaissance before you upload gr-drain.csv.

|    | GitHub Checks |
| :- | :- |
| * |  Confirm you are in the **data.world/raw-data/adopt-a-drain** GitHub folder   |
| * |  Find the **upload files** button  |
